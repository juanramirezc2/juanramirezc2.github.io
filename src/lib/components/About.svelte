      <p>
        I'm a passionate Frontend Engineering Lead with expertise in building
        scalable, performant web applications. With years of experience leading
        engineering teams, I specialize in crafting exceptional user experiences
        using modern technologies like TypeScript, React, and Svelte.
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe in clean code, thoughtful architecture, and creating products
        that make a real impact. When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring
        new technologies, mentoring developers, and contributing to the web
        development community.
